<b>SCCanvas</b> is a tiny framework for HTML5 canvas in JavaScript

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
The main goal of <b>SCC</b> is to provide an easy way to manipulate visual objects into a canvas.
The event detection is in charge of the framework, you only need to implement an individual comportement with event functions into your objects.
When <b>SCC</b> will detect an event, it will find the object impacted and launch the corresponding event function if they exist.
