SCCanvas is a tiny framework for HTML5 canvas in JavaScript
-----------------------------------------------------------



The main goal of **SCC** is to provide an easy way to manipulate visual objects into a canvas.
The event detection is in charge of the framework, you only need to implement an individual comportement with event functions into your objects.
When **SCC** will detect an event, it will find the object impacted and launch its corresponding event function if it is defined. This allows to refresh the context only if necessary.

---

Init
---

(more parameters for canvas setting available soon)

```javascript
var param_init = {
  id: "id-canvas",
  width: 600,
  height: 400,
  millisec: 10
};
SCC.init(param_init);
```

---

Creating and adding objects
---

Once you've initiated **SCC**, you can add objects ; one by one or with an array.
If you want them to react to mouse events, you need to define a *mask* or to implement an *intersect* function. The mask will also be used by a defaultDraw function if you don't want to implement your own *draw* function. Here is a list of attributes and functions you can use : 

- id (string - not necessary) : will allow you to find your objects later, will be generated by SCC if it doesn't exist
- z (number - not necessary) : depth of your object, usefull for the rendering, 0 if not exists
- mask (object or array - not necessary) : an array of {x,y} for a polygon mask or {radius:number, center: {x,y}} for a circle mask, also usefull for default drawing
- intersect (function({x,y}) - not necessary) : a function to detect an intersection with the mouse, must return a boolean
- draw (function(context) - not necessary) : drawing method
- fill (string - not necessary) : usefull for default drawing method
- stroke (string - not necessary) : usefull for default drawing method
- strokeWeight (number - not necessary) : usefull for defaulot drawing method

The add method uses a single param object, the attribute for your single object or your array of objects is <i>elt</i>. You can also specify a new rendering after adding object(true by default) with the render attribute : 

```javascript
param_add = {elt: myDatas};
SCC.add( param_add );
```
Thanks to chaining pattern, you can use **SCC** like this : 

```javascript
SCC.init(param_init).add(param_add).bang("grow");
```

---

Event functions
---

There is a set of event functions you can implement into your objects : 

- click
- rclick : right click
- cclick : center click
- mousein
- mouseout
- drag
- release
- custom events : your can implement your own event function and launch it thanks to the SCC.bang method :

 ```javascript
 SCC.bang({event: "your event name", id: "object-id"})
 ```
 if the id is not defined in the bang parameter object, the event will   be launch for all objects implementing the event function.


Available event functions parameters and return mechanism
---

the only parameter you can use is *step*, the number of executions of your current event function since the event detection.
The animation manager will continue to call it while it return true : 

```javascript
click: function(){
  this.color = 'black';
}
```

The first function will be executed just one time

```javascript
mousein: function(s){
  this.mask.radius += 1;
  return s < 20;
}
```

The second function will be executed 20 times, so the radius of the object will grow during 20 * SCC.millisec

SCUtil is a tiny util lib in JavaScript and inspired by processing & processing.js utilities

- rotate : 
    * @arg0 : a point or an array of point to rotate
    * @arg1 : angle in radian
    * @arg2 : (not necessary) point, center of rotation, (0,0) if not specified
